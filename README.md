# Warning ⚠
Don't include <stdio.h> anymore 😨

EasyC.h is Here 😎


## How much easier? 🤔

You can compare [example with EasyC](https://github.com/Ahmadrezadl/EasyC.h/blob/master/Example%20With%20EasyC.c) and [same program without EasyC](https://github.com/Ahmadrezadl/EasyC.h/blob/master/Example%20Without%20EasyC.c) 😊 


## Some Functions in this header:

```c
//Easy Scanners Like:
nextInt(); //Scans Next Int and returns it.
next(name); //Scans name (String) and returns it.
nextBool(); //Scans Next Boolean and returns it.
nextChar(); //Scans Next char and returns it. Avoids '\n' & ' ' (white space)
//etc...

//Easy for (i = 0 to n):
foreach(i,10)
n[i] = nextInt();

//Famous sorts in your pocket:
bubbleSort(n,10)
```
